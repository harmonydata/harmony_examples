# Contribute to Harmony

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Harmony. This repository is explicitly for real life code examples where researchers have found Harmony useful and want to share their R notebooks or Jupyter notebooks.

## Adding your notebook

You can simply upload a file and create a pull request in Git. We welcome your contribution.

If you get stuck you can check out the [contributing guide on the main Harmony repo](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. If you'd like to contribute to the core Python, R or API repos, you are also welcome.
